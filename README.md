vagrant-for-noobs
=================

A basic Vagrant box to get you started with cross-platform web development

## Instructions

Download and install
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

Using a command line utility (if you're on Windows I recommend Windows PowerShell) navigate to where you cloned this repository to. This will be the root folder of your new workspace.

Type `vagrant up` and hit enter to get the party started.

When it's finished, navigate to [localhost:8080](//localhost:8080) to see your `public` Vagrant folder. What you can see is the site being hosted on the virtual machine inside of your computer. Freaky!


## How to use

`vagrant up` to start working

`vagrant halt` to stop working

`vagrant destroy` to delete the box

`vagrant up` to rebuild it
